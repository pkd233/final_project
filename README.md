# final_project
This repository holds all files for the final project for the Drawing on the Web course taught by Joshua Clayton, Spring 2016.
This project uses images I have taken of my brother and sister-in-law's dog, named Daenerys. The first page introduces you to her namesake, in a image, where you can draw stars around her. Once you click on the image, you are introduced to Dani.
This project uses p5 to create stars on the homepage, and uses CSS animation and transitions to change the images on the next page from black and white into color.
